    <p>Digha, located in the East Midnapore district of West Bengal, is one of the oldest and most popular beach destinations in Eastern India. Often dubbed the ‚ÄúBrighton of the East,‚Äù it features a wide stretch of golden beach bordered by casuarina trees and is a top weekend getaway from Kolkata. Known for its vibrant beachside vibe, shopping stalls, and easy accessibility, Digha caters to families, couples, and groups of friends alike.
It‚Äôs divided into Old Digha (rocky shore, promenades, and local markets) and New Digha (wider beach, smoother waves, and more peaceful surroundings), each offering a unique coastal experience.
</p>
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <p>Digha Beach, located in the Purba Medinipur district of West Bengal, holds a significant place in the state‚Äôs coastal heritage. Originally known as Beerkul, this beach was first mentioned in the writings of Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of British India, during the late 18th century. He was captivated by its tranquil beauty and serene ambiance.

      The British colonial administration first noticed Digha‚Äôs potential as a seaside retreat in the 1920s. They developed basic infrastructure such as roads and bungalows, encouraging the Bengali middle class to visit the sea for leisure and health benefits. After India‚Äôs independence, the West Bengal government actively promoted Digha as a model tourist destination, investing in hotels, promenades, and recreational facilities throughout the mid-1900s.
      
      The transformation of Digha into a popular tourist destination began in the early 20th century when an Englishman named John Frank Snaith, who had settled in the region, started promoting the beach‚Äôs potential as a seaside resort. With his efforts and support from the Bengal government, infrastructure development took place, slowly turning Digha into the "Brighton of the East."
      
      Digha‚Äôs popularity rose after independence, especially during the 1950s and 60s, as the West Bengal government developed it as a family-friendly beach town. Over the years, the beach has evolved into one of the most visited coastal spots in Eastern India, known for its shallow, gentle waves, long stretches of sandy shores, and accessible location from Kolkata.
      
     In recent times, New Digha has developed beside Old Digha, offering improved facilities and becoming a modern extension of the historical beach. Despite modernization, Digha still retains the charm of its colonial-era beginnings and continues to attract tourists year-round.
