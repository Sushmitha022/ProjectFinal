    <p>Chandrabhaga Beach is known for its clean shoreline, mystic charm, and mythological significance. According to legend, the beach is named after Chandrabhaga, a devoted daughter who sacrificed herself to protect her honor. This historic connection adds a layer of spiritual aura to the beach, making it a revered spot for both locals and tourists. 
Apart from its mythological roots, Chandrabhaga is Odisha‚Äôs first Blue Flag certified beach, recognized for its eco-friendly initiatives and safety standards. The beach is perfect for a quiet getaway, surrounded by casuarina groves and offering breathtaking views of the sunrise. It's also a popular destination during the annual Chandrabhaga Mela held in February, attracting pilgrims and tourists alike.

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <p>Chandrabhaga Beach, located near the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Konark Sun Temple, is deeply rooted in mythology and history. The beach derives its name from the river Chandrabhaga, which once flowed into the Bay of Bengal but has now dried up. According to ancient legends, Chandrabhaga was the name of a devout maiden who sacrificed her life to uphold her dignity and devotion. It is said that she chose to drown herself in the river rather than succumb to the advances of the Sun God. Her act of purity and courage is remembered and honored to this day, and the beach has become a place of religious importance.

      Historical references also link the beach to rituals and healing practices. It was once believed that bathing in the waters at Chandrabhaga could cure leprosy and skin diseases, drawing both locals and pilgrims seeking spiritual and physical cleansing. Ancient texts and temple records suggest that Chandrabhaga Beach was a sacred site for sun worship and ritual bathing, especially during Magha Saptami, when thousands still gather for the holy dip. The beach has also gained recognition in modern times for being one of India‚Äôs first Blue Flag-certified beaches, preserving its legacy of sanctity while embracing sustainability and environmental responsibility.
      
      During the medieval period, Chandrabhaga was known for its Makara Sankranti celebrations, when thousands gathered for a ritual dip, believing the waters to have healing properties. Though the original river has now dried up, the beach has retained its sanctity. The confluence of legend, religion, and marine history gives Chandrabhaga a timeless significance, marking it as more than a scenic spot ‚Äî it is a living link to Odisha‚Äôs cultural and maritime roots.
      
      In contemporary times, Chandrabhaga has become an eco-tourism hub, known for its unspoiled beauty, environmental cleanliness, and proximity to heritage sites. It was one of the first beaches in India to receive the Blue Flag certification, a global mark of environmental excellence, blending ancient sanctity with modern sustainability.
