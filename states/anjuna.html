    <p>Anjuna Beach is where Goa‚Äôs free-spirited, bohemian heart beats the loudest. Known since the 1960s for its hippie culture, Anjuna still retains that laid-back, alternative vibe. The beach has a rocky coastline dotted with soft sandy patches, bordered by coconut palms and red laterite cliffs. Waves crash against the rocks, creating a dramatic and scenic backdrop that makes Anjuna unique among Goa‚Äôs beaches. It‚Äôs famous for its legendary Anjuna Flea Market, held every Wednesday, where travelers can shop for everything from handmade jewelry and dreamcatchers to musical instruments and ethnic clothes. During the tourist season, the beach hosts trance music parties and festivals that attract a global crowd. With its mix of natural charm, cultural expression, and vibrant nightlife, Anjuna Beach remains a top choice for creative souls and explorers.</p>
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <p>Anjuna Beach is one of the most iconic names in Goa‚Äôs cultural and historical map, largely because of its unique journey from a quiet fishing village to the heart of Goa‚Äôs countercultural movement. In pre-colonial times, Anjuna was inhabited by local communities who lived off fishing, cashew farming, and small-scale trading. The region's rocky coast, red laterite cliffs, and fertile land made it ideal for coconut and spice cultivation. During Portuguese rule, Anjuna was part of the Bardez district, and its people experienced the cultural shifts brought by colonial influence, though the village maintained a low profile compared to commercial ports like Old Goa or Panaji.

      The beach‚Äôs transformation began in the 1960s when it became one of the first Goan destinations discovered by Western travelers, particularly those following the global hippie trail. Drawn by the dramatic landscape, spiritual atmosphere, and lack of tourist crowds, Anjuna became a haven for free-spirited individuals seeking alternative lifestyles. Here, they found freedom to express through music, meditation, and art. Full-moon parties became a signature attraction, blending Indian spirituality with Western electronic music and creating a new cultural phenomenon that would define Anjuna for decades to come.
      
      As word of Anjuna‚Äôs unique vibe spread, more travelers arrived, and a community of artists, musicians, and seekers formed along its shores. The now-famous Anjuna Flea Market began as a barter system among these travelers, trading handmade crafts, clothing, and accessories. Over the years, the beach has maintained its identity as a creative and expressive space. Today, Anjuna is not only a tourist destination but also a cultural landmark that represents the spirit of openness, experimentation, and cross-cultural exchange that defines modern Goa.
